# VotifierForge_1710
Some votifier thing for forge 1.7.10, too many errors building against votifier to make listeners so I just I rewrote it with forge stuff. I use it just for me, I just put it here to pad out my git account.

The "scripting" replacement stuff only has support for 
\<NAME> 
<SERVICE_LIST> 
\<SERVICE> 
\<GOLD> 
\<GRAY> 
\<GREEN> 
and but if you really want to change it I'm sure you can figure it out.

Reload the config from file, won't reinitialize what port votifier is running on, but can be used to change vote reward strings. 
/reloadvr
/reloadvoterewards
